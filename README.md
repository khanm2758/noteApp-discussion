## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js & npm:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://nodejs.org/ "null").
    
-   **MongoDB:** You need a running MongoDB instance. This can be a local installation or a cloud-based service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas "null").
    

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    
    ```
    
2.  **Install dependencies:** Run the following command in the project's root directory to install all the required npm packages.
    
    ```
    npm install
    
    ```
    
3.  **Create an environment file:** Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your MongoDB connection string. This is the URI that your application will use to connect to the database.
    
    **.env**
    
    ```
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName"
    
    ```
    
    _(Replace the URI with your actual MongoDB connection string.)_
    
4.  **Start the server:** Run the following command to start the Express server.
    
    ```
    node app.js
    
    ```
    
    Or, if you have `nodemon` installed for development:
    
    ```
    nodemon app.js
    
    ```
    
5.  **Access the application:** Once the server is running, you will see the message `server running on port 3000` in your console. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
